        <p><em><strong>developers are responsible for creating the user interface and experience of websites and applications. <br>
          They are the ones who make sure that the website or application is visually appealing, easy to use, and responsive.<br>
           A good front-end developer should have a strong understanding of <mark>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,</mark> as well as a good sense of design.<br>
            They should also be able to empathize with users and understand their needs, as well as communicate effectively with other<br>
             members of the development team 123. According to Zell Liew, a good front-end developer should also have strong communication skills,<br>
              be empathetic, and have a good sense of design 1. CSS-Tricks suggests that a good front-end developer should be flexible,<br>
              eager to learn, eager to share, and have a pragmatic approach to the ever-changing landscape<br>
              
              
          <p>  2. Go Make Things argues that the best front-end developers are not necessarily the best coders but are the best communicators<br>
               who can clearly document their work and explain what they did and why to people who donâ€™t always have the same technical<br>
                skills or background 3. In summary, a good front-end developer is someone who has a strong understanding of <mark>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,</mark><br> 
                has a good sense of design, is empathetic towards users, communicates effectively with other members of the development team,<br>
                 is flexible and eager to learn new things.</p>
